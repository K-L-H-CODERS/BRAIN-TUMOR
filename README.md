# BRAIN-TUMOR Autofocus Layer for Semantic Segmentation
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a PyTorch implementation of the autofocus convolutional layer proposed for semantic segmentation with the objective of enhancing the capabilities of neural networks for multi-scale processing. Autofocus layers adaptively change the size of the effective receptive field based on the processed context to generate more powerful features. The proposed autofocus layer can be easily integrated into existing networks to improve a model's representational power.

Here we apply the autofocus convolutional layer to deep neural networks for 3D semantic segmentation. We run experiments on the Brain Tumor Image Segmentation dataset (BRATS2015) as an example to show how the models work. In addition, we also implement a series of deep learning based models used for 3D Semantic Segmentation. The details of all the models implemented here can be found in our paper: Autofocus Layer for Semantic Segmentation.</p>
We are using Image processing to identify the tumor present in the Brain
